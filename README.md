# RISC_V
I designed a 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on the
Harvard Architecture, which executes instructionsin a single clock cycle.
Thisinvolved implementing instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back,
and program counter update operations within a single cycle, resulting in improved
performance and reduced latency
